Time Series Stock Forecasting
This project is part of my internship at Zidio Development, where I developed a time series forecasting dashboard using multiple statistical and machine learning models to analyze and predict stock prices. The final output was visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Project Overview
The objective of this project was to forecast future stock trends using real-world Toyota stock price data. I applied various forecasting models and evaluated their accuracy using industry-standard metrics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
Prophet (Facebook)
LSTM (TensorFlow / Keras)
Power BI for dashboard visualization

🧠 Forecasting Models Used
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
Prophet (by Facebook)
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)

📈 Highlights
Cleaned and preprocessed time series data
Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)Forecasted trends using multiple models
Evaluated accuracy using MAE, RMSE
Integrated 30-day and 7-day moving averages
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to display predictions and trends
